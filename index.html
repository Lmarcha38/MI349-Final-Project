        <h2>About SauceyPlayz</h2>
        <img src="images/CoolSaucey.png" alt="Profile Picture of SauceyPlayz" class="imgCenterSm">
        <p class="pCenter">I am SauceyPlayz, an indie video game developer. I have been developing games for many years now, but I have only released one game with another one that is soon to follow. I am inspired by my favorite video games to create experiences for other people to enjoy.</p>
        <h4>My top 5 favorite games in order are: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Titanfall 2</li>
            <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</li>
            <li>Pokemon Heartgold</li>
            <li>Pokemon Legends Arceus</li>
            <li>Persona 3 Reload</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pCenter">While I can't possibly list every single inspiration I have, these ones are some of my favorites. It is my hope that my games are played and enjoyed by lots of people, and maybe I can inspire someone else.</p>
