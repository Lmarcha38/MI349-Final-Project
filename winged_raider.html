            <p class="gameDescTxt">Winged Raider is a 2D Rougelike Shooter game available for Windows PC and MacOS on <a title="Winged Raider Steam page" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141710/Winged_Raider/">Steam</a>. It is free and released on September 23rd 2022. In Winged Raider, you need to infiltrate the Winged Castle to eliminate the evil that lurks within. Using items that you find throughout the castle, you must defeat all the bosses in one life to win. In retrospect, this game is very hard and few people have beaten it. A lot of the reviews for Winged Raider complain that the game is far too difficult. For my first ever release, I am okay with this and it has only served as a learning opportunity for me. I am the only person who playtested the game, and this was clearly a mistake. Playtesting games allows you to find what makes a game good and what needs to be improved, and you need more than just one perspective.Perhaps someday I will make a Winged Raider 2, but for now I can improve my other projects upon these mistakes. I will always love Winged Raider for being my first release! Thanks to my friend <a title="Trippycat's YouTube Channel" href="https://www.youtube.com/@_Trippycat">Trippycat</a> for making the music for this game.</p>
