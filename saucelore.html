            <p class="gameDescTxt">SauceLore is a Turn-Based RPG targeted for Windows PC and MacOS on Steam. SauceLore is about the story of Saucey, who finds himself in a strange kingdom known as Daanco. The king of Daanco tells Saucey that he has been chosen as their savior, and must help them save the kingdom from a growing evil. He is tasked with uniting the people of the kingdom so they can make a stand against the looming evil. Players will be able to play this adventure, with the ability to control Saucey and the friends he meets in the Kingodm of Daanco in their fights against evil. SauceLore will also include a few minigames and some optional sidequests for some cool in-game rewards! Unfortunately, there is no planned release date for SauceLore at this time, but I am working hard to finish making the game!</p>
